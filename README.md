# Database WBL
High performance data processing employs high performance computing (HPC) to process data, which is then translated into information and knowledge. The advent of high-performance computing and data analytics enabled real-time interrogation of extremely large data sets. This course covers the fundamentals of high- performance computing, data processing, and high-performance data processing architecture. Students will also be exposed to case studies in industry and research that make use of high-performance data processing. Students will gain hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) as a data processing platform.

## About Us
